=== Christian Science Monitor - Dispute Finder: Making the Call on Web 'Facts' ===

Chris Gaylord - October 13th, 2009

The Christian Science Monitor wrote a nice article about Disputed Finder.

<blockquote>
To help readers, Mr. Ennals developed an online veracity alert system. The software, called Dispute Finder, sniffs through what you are reading online. If anything smells fishy – perhaps questionable poll results or references to “death panels” – Ennals’s code blows a whistle and says, “This is disputed. Here’s the evidence.”

=== The Canadian Press - New tool flags disputed claims on web, but observers say its an uphill battle ===

James Keller - August 19th, 2009

The Canadian Press wrote a syndicated article that talks about Dispute Finder. 
A quote:

<blockquote>
Developers of new web browsing software that flags questionable claims or outright lies on the web hope it will become a valuable tool to deal with the misinformation that litters the Internet.

But observers say Dispute Finder, an experimental browser extension developed by Intel, and the many websites that already aim to debunk online rumours and falsehoods face an enormous task. It isn't as easy as simply telling someone they're wrong
</blockquote>

As they point out, one of the biggest challenges with Dispute Finder is persuading people to take seriously opinions that come from a different side. Our long-term plan for addressing this problem is to present peolpe with evidence from sources that they already trust and pitch an opinion using arguments compatible their own view of the world. Even taking that into account, we realise that once someone has formed an opinion it is hard to make them change, and realistically our best hope is probably to draw attention to issues where someone has not yet formed a strong opinion.

Rob Enderle - June 22nd, 2009

Rob Enderle made Dispute Finder his project of the week.

<blockquote>
While this is one of the riskiest efforts I've ever seen any vendor undertake, (because folks view those who present alternative views as biased, and both sides may not initially be populated), it is also likely one of the most important. Dispute Finder is therefore a natural for my product of the week.

This article about the <a href="http://berkeley.intel-research.net/">Intel Research Berkeley</a> Open House 2009 leads with a piece about [[Think Link]].

Nice opening:

<blockquote>
A popular Web comic portrays a stick figure feverishly typing at a keyboard. "Are you coming to bed?" he's asked, off-panel. "I can't," he replies. "Someone is wrong on the Internet!"

What if someone else could do that work for you? An Intel project that the company presented at its R&D day at U.C. Berkeley envisioned just that.
