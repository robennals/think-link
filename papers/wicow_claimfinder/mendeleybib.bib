annote = {New metric avoids extracting exact and semi-exact matches. (not good)

        
Performance:
LCP n-gram metric is better than edit distance.
BLEU is the worst.
Sumo beans LCP, but may not have desired features.

        

        
Designed specifically for building a corpus of paraphrases - so they want them to be different.

        

        
[3] links sentences if they share n-grams.
[4] also looks at context similarity

        
Asside: if I get something working, I should probably release it as a reusable library - and indeed should do the same with all my other code.

        
Release as Scala machine learning library?

        
Levenshtein distance.
   - number of words added/removed/changed/with different suffix/replaced with similar

        

        
Word-simple N-gram overlap
  - Count how many 1-grams, 2-grams, 3-grams etc overlap between the sentences
   Usually N is chosen equal to 4 or less.

        
sim(Sa,Sb) = (1/N)*Sum(Count\_match(n-gram)/Count(n-gram)

        
Proportion of n-grams that are matched between the senences.

        

        
LCP (Longest common prefix)

        
If an n-gram matches, then don't consider any of its prefixes - but do consider n-grams that start after the first word.

        
sim(Sa,Sb) = max\_n(Count\_match(n-gram)/Count(n-gram))

        
Choose n such that the largest proportion of n-grams is matched.

        

        
BLEU metric

        
Another metric based on the proportion of n-grams that overlap.

        

        
Sumo metric:

        
S(x,y,l) = a log\_2(x/l) + b log\_2(y/l)

        
where l is number of shared words, x and y are number of words in the two sentences, and a/b are weights that sum to 1. In experiments, they set both to 0.5.

        
log\_2 penalizes pairs that are very similar (seems odd).

        
Seems like there is a danger of division by zero if l = 0.

        
Metric seems weird and not necessarily what we want.

abstract = {The LARK RNA-binding protein (RBP) has well documented roles in the circadian systems of Drosophila and mammals. Recent studies have demonstrated that the Drosophila LARK RBP is associated with many mRNA targets, in vivo, including those that regulate either neurophysiology or development of the nervous system. In the present study, we have employed conditional expression techniques to distinguish developmental and physiological functions of LARK for a defined class of neurons: the Pigment-Dispersing Factor (PDF)-containing LNv clock neurons. We found that increased LARK expression during development dramatically alters the small LNv class of neurons with no obvious effects on the large LNv cells. Conversely, conditional expression of LARK at the adult stage results in altered clock protein rhythms and circadian locomotor activity, even though neural morphology is normal in such animals. Electrophysiological analyses at the larval neuromuscular junction indicate a role for LARK in regulating neuronal excitability. Altogether, our results demonstrate that LARK activity is critical for neuronal development and physiology.},

annote = {Probably the tool most similar to think link.

        
Ideas can include references we web resources. But assumption is that users are using web resource as evidence for argument, rather than wanting to highlight contentious stuff.

        
All ideas other than one's own have their owner clearly indicated iconically. (Think Link should do this).

        
Cohere has a firefox plugin that allows one to easily mark snippets and can show you ideas that other people have attached to a web site.
   However it does not distinguish between contested and non-contested ideas.

        
Usage model is different. Not trying to gather two sides and join them together. About using web as evidence.

        

        
-- 

        
A tool for "social bookmarking, idea-linking, and argument visualization".

        
Says:
"Students, researchers, and professional analysts lack effective tools to make personal and collective sense of problems while working in distributed teams".

        
"The intended users of such tools include members of the public engagedin a public consultations and societal debate [8], students or educators in a learning context [9], lawyers [10], and analysts in many other walks of professional life such as public policy [11] and scholarly publishing [12]"

        
-- cohere itself --

        
Start with relaxed constraints, but allow users to incrementally add structure.

        
Drop-down menu encourages people to reuse an existing idea rather than creating a new one
 - we found a drop-down menu isn't enough. You need to let people explore to see what it is.

        
Can assign websites to ideas.
 - but direction is opposite to think link.
 - using web site as evidence, rather than as thing to highlight to draw people in.

        
Ideas can play roles such as Question, Answer, Pro, Con.
Use can define new ones - e.g. Datum, Claim, Warrant for Toulmin.

        
Connection types have either positive, negative, or neutral polarity.
Defaults include proves, is-consistent-with, challenges, refutes.

        
Users are free to create their own connection language. Also entirely up to users to determine what positive and negative mean (e.g. could be inhibit in biology).

        
Web feeds allow one to track changes to ones' own items (like Think Link).

        
Ideas have their own URls - same in Think Link.
 - mention simple API.

"First, there are desktopapplications like Compendium [30] and Rationale [16] with high quality user interfaces refined through the feedback from their extensive user communities: however, these are limited to publishing read-only maps to the Web, either as JPEG images, or as interactive image maps."

        
Compendium and Rationale are limited to read-only on the web.

        
"CoPe\_it! [18] is designed forcommunity deliberation, and provides a way to synchronise views between IBIS graphs
(it also integrates with Compendium in this respect), an IBIS outline tree, and a conventional threaded discussion forum. CoPe\_it! also provides a mechanism to evaluate the strength of a position, and so represents another interesting development. Its interaction design is at present rather rudimentary compared to Web 2.0 interfaces."

        
Parmenides enforces aparticular argument ontology (it was not designed as a social web application) and does not appear to support any other Web 2.0 characteristics.

        
ClaiMaker and ClaimSpotter were precursors to Cohere.

        
TruthMapping goes much further than this, aiming specifically at tackling some ofthe limitations of threaded discussion forums, with a clear distinction between unsupported premises, which when supported become claims, and a way to post rebuttals and responses to each of these [22]. DebateMapper uses a combined graphical
and outline structure to map debates using the IBIS scheme, with contributions tagged as issues, positions and arguments [23].

        
The provision of mechanisms to enable flexible linking of web resources aroundwhat we are calling Ideas is a goal shared by the Topic Maps community [26],

        
-- topic maps --

        
Topics point to one or more resources (web sites) and can be linked by associations.
-- me --

        
Think Link takes a less involved approach. You aren't trying to explore an issue you know is interesting - you want to find out when things you didn't know are contentious actually are.
 Think Link is not a collaborative argumentation tool in a strict sense. The aim is to assemble the information you would want to see, rather than impose a rigid structure. Structure is only there to show you what info you might want to look at.

        
Focus is in finding things, rather than organizing them.

Ok if person is prepared to read several versions of the same story and find the differences.

        
But user may want to read only one version, and then be told just what statements are disputed. For some of these, the user may not care (it was a minor issue) or have a strong opinion (and thus not be interested in seeing other points of view). We target the case in which they do care, but don't yet have a strong opinion.

        
Clusters articles based on keywords that indicate their "aspect". Biased towards words that appear early in the article.

Integrates a number of known techniques:

        
IBIS + articles + voting.

        
Uses the IBIS formalism.

        
-- 

        
Effective deliberation requires that:
*   All important issues are considered
•  The broadest possible range of high-quality solution ideas are identified
•  The strongest arguments for and against each idea are captured
•  People can distinguish good from bad arguments
•  Individual select solutions rationally, i.e. they consider all the important issues and ideas, and
•  make selections that are consistent with the arguments they most trust
*  The aggregate results fairly represent the “wisdom of the people”

        

        
Break into sharing, funnelling, and argumentation.

        
problems with just sharing: noise, unsystematic coverage, balkanization, dysfunctional argumentation, hidden consensus

        
Funnelling: voting, prediction markets, etc. Combining opinions.

        
Uses IBIS: because it is simple to use and has been applied successfully in hundreds of collective decision-making contexts.

        
Includes articles in the argument map.
  Disagree by writing a new article, rather than editing someone else's.
?:   Debate continues by updating your own articles, rather than posting endless replies.

Awareness = understanding of the activities of others.

        
Presents a list of awareness mechanisms:

        
* Informal: who is around and what are they doing
* Presence: User availability and willingness to collaborate
* Task: Aim of a task and how it fits in a bigger picture
* Social: degree of attention and interest of a member
* Group-structure: roles, responsibilities etc
* Historical
* Workspace

-- Argumentations --

        
Site to develop argument maps. People build simple argument trees.
No papers. No research. 

        
-- Argumentative --

        
Windows app for building argument maps.

        
-- Cohere --

        
Simon Buckingham Shum et al.
Annotate a URL with ideas. Make connections between ideas.
Links such as responds-to.
Links to related URLS, but isn't about identifying repeated bad ideas.
Has a firefox plugin.
Uses various visualizations.

        
Use websites to back up ideas, rather than connection going the other way.

        
Plugin: 
 v1: just let you quickly mark up ideas you found on a page
 v2: also shows you ideas that others have marked

        
Gets much closer to our work.
Key difference: we focus on the pages. About showing you when stuff you read in contentious.

        
http://technologies.kmi.open.ac.uk/cohere/2008/08/29/updates-to-cohere-browser-plugin/

        
Toolbar shows a list of ideas marked on the page. But: this will include ideas that aren't contentious. Not done by highlighting. Different usage model.

        
-- Compendium --

        
Argument graphing tool. From Simon Buckingham Shum, Jeff Conklin, et al.

        
-- CoPe it! --

        
Another shared argument graph tool.

        
-- DebateGraph --

        
Web based argument visualization + collaborative wiki editing.

        
Uses a nice argument visualization.The argument is shown as a single tree that can be expanded downwards.
Further graph on the righ shows multiple parents for it.
-- Debatewise --

        
Debatewise is a not-for-profit debating wiki with ambitions to become the Wikipedia of debate.Anyone can start a debate on any subject they like and anyone can edit and strengthen that debate.    

        
Simple site listing pro and con arguments for topics.

        
-- The Deliberatorium/Collaboratorium --

        
From MIT.
Uses Argument Mapping to reduce "scattering" and "the soapbox problem". Break into refute, update, etc.

        
-- IDeM --

        
Idea Market.
Information aggregation market environment.
Little info available.

        
-- Open Qabal --

        
Blog engine and comment/collaboration system.

        
-- Rationale --

        
Visual framework to consider the pros and cons of an issue. Desktop app rather than web based. Fancy windows app.

        
-- TopicSpaces --

        
Java based subject map platform. Little info available.

        
-- TruthMapping --

        
Use nice revision system to update your rebuttals and keep things tidy. Add "critiques" to things, and update in light of stuff other people say. Pretty cool. Similar to delibatorium IIRC.

One problem with hypertext is disorientation.

        
One problem is that hypertext author cannot formally express the order in which hypertext should be browsed.

"Browsing Semantics" means a specification of the order in which nodes should be visited.

Net consists of places, transitions, and arcs.

        
Transition is an event.

        
Arcs go between places and events, never between places or between transitions.

User enters informal annotation and system guides user to translate it into a formal structure.

        
System creates plausible paraphrases within the ontology. User selects the one that is correct.

        
If new terms appear, system suggests suitable enhancements to the ontology.

        
System called ACE. Extension of the TRELLIS annotation tool.

        
UI lists a number of suggested changes to the statement, which the user can turn on and off using check boxes.

        
UI then suggests several formal statements it may be making.

        

        
Can be used to annotate a document with the meanings of its text.

        
--

        
In our approach, users enter a short sentence in free text to describe all or part of a document, and the system presents a set of potential paraphrases of the sentence that are generated from valid expressions in the ontology, from which the user chooses the closest match.

        
Handcrafted annotations can be more accurate and allow an author to express things the way the want to. However formal annotations let us do more powerful stuff.

        

        
-- TRELLIS --

        
Aids decision making process.

        
A statement is a piece of free text or data that may or may not have been extracted from a document.

        
Link statements together with constructions like "is supported by" or "in contrast with".

        
ACE extends TRELLIS by helping users formalise their statements.

        

        
-- techniques --

        
* Suggest rewriting specific terms with their canonical values. E.g. replace "forwards" with "strikers".

        
* Suggest simplifications, base on parsing.

---

        
Part of Scholarly Ontologies project, which aims at buliding a network of interpretations enriching a corpus of scholarly papers. One does not have "right" and "wrong" values.

        
Semantic web is about representing knowledge which is known to be true. Scholarly Ontologies is instead about knowledge which is open to debate.

        
Scholarly documents are annotated or enriched with (possibly contradicting) interpretions made by readers.

        
Annotations are expressed as triples/claims. [node,relation,node]

        
Nodes can be chunks of text, or (typed) concepts.
The relation is in an instance of a class defined in a formal ontology.

        

        
The knowledge may not actually appear in the documents (unlike semantic web), and may be different for different annotators.

        

        
Builds on "Scholarly Publishing and Argument in Hypertext"

        
Shipman quote
 "Users are hesitant about formalization because of a fear of prematurely committing to a specific perspective on their tasks; this may be especially true in a collaborative setting where people must agree on an appropriate formalism"
  [2] - Supporting Knowledge Base Evolution with Incremental Formalization

Create link model specific for a given domain - not one size fits all.

        
--

        
Most semantic-net based hypertext systems leave the linking consistency of the net to individual users. Users without guidance may accidentally introduce structural and relational inconsistencies in the semantic nets. The relational inconsistency hinders the creation of domain information models.
Typed links a very old idea in hypertext, and standards exist for the web (though not widely used).

        

        
Three types of hypertext structures:
* unstructured - arbitrary node and link types
* semistructured - recommended link types, but also use own
* structured - fixed set of node and link types, and rules about what can link to what with what type

        

        

        
Authors created the MUCH hypertext system (Man Using and Creating Hypertext).

        
Found that users did not use link types - everyone used the default link type. When a non-default type was used, it was often inconsistent with uses by others.

        
Uses a depth-first algorithm to generate hierachial views for printing purposes. KMS also does this.

Allows people to comment on a transcript of video. Could be applied to text. Highlights text in red if discussed.

        
Key actions are "mark as a claim" and "comment on an existing claim". Comments can be given typed tags.

        
References lots of useful material from other fields.

        
About rating a particular speaker, rather than the core idea. Rate them for validity, accuracy, reliabliity, comprehensiveness.

Allow people to respond to criticisms of information quality in online political videos and their transcripts.

        
Aimed at politically astute people such as bloggers.

        
Rate accuracy, credibility, expertise, and trust.

        
Could also apply same technique to a purely textual article.

        
Interviewed three local political bloggers and surveyed 27 people. Did think-aloud walkthroughs with 2 local political bloggers.

        
Supports both unconstrained comments and typed annotations.

        
Doesn't seem to link stuff as part of a greater graph.

        
Validity = well groundedness or logical correctness of a claim. Are they correctly interpreting their sources?

        
High level annotations are "mark as a claim" and "add a comment".

        
Can associate with an external source. Can rate trust and expertise of a source on a three point scale.

        
Also allows user-defined tags.

= Problems voiced about IBIS =
== Concept ==

        
People objecting to the idea that argument was needed. See themselves as right. People come from different camps and are not interested in seeing the other point of view.

        
People assume there is one "optimal" solution and thus no need for a discourse.

        
May not see the need for a question that is being answered.

        
See decisions as being made based on power structures and don't see how argumentation will help them.

        
Problem when only one camp uses IBIS and their opponents don't use it to debate with them.

        
People do participate in IBIS but use social pressures to affect the outcome. Use IBIS in a destructive way.

        
== Incorrect Expectations ==

        
Important to describe what IBIS is not. People think the tool is intelligent and will solve the problems for them.

        
See it as a retreival system - but instead just a place you can put data you find yourself.

        
== Method related difficulties ==

        
People had little difficulty understanding an argument that was already represented inside the system.

        
Much harder to correctly add information to the system.

        
Have to break arguments down into atoms and connect these atoms together correctl - which people find hard.

        
A question may contain more than one underlying issue - what are you rebutting? How do you arganize?

        
Connections between statements might make sense when created but not when looked at later as the context is lost. Outside of a train of thought, might not appreaciate why this implies that.

        
People miss out important intermediate steps that make arguments hard to understand.

        
Can get a "pedantry" problem where people make the action too distanct from the original question.

        
= ASSIDE: looking at solution suggestions ==

        
  Topic: How should we reduce traffic?
   -> Claim: Increasing traffic costs would reduce traffic
     -> Topic: How should we increase traffic costs?"
       -> Claim: Increasing gas price would increase traffic costs?

        
   Claim: Increasing gas price would reduce traffic costs.
    Supports: Increasing traffic costs would reduce traffic
    Supports: Increasing gas price would increase traffic costs

        
We merge "Topic" and "Issue".  Call "claim" alternative.

        
= Think Link differences =

        
Not aiming to come to a solution. Just want to show you the most interesting information you might want to use in making a decision. An information gathering execise.

        
Not aiming to have a formal meaning to a link. Instead just a list of things that you may find useful when arguing for or against. Does not need to have a logical implication relationship.
 - this is why there is no "AND" relation
 - and why "relates" is there incase you
  aren't sure, or it is on both
  sides

        
Not everyone will want to know other points of view, but some people will. Even if a person has set views on one issue, they may not in other areas. I may have strong views about the existence of god, but feel I know little about which foods are healthy and want to avoid being misled.

        
Voting ordered system encourages a loose, relaxed approach to argument forming. Doesn't matter if you pollute graph with losely related stuff - rely on voting to pick out the important stuff. No need to go to great effort to pick subset.

        
FUTURE WORK: proper studies on how different argumentation systems compare. Do these changes help? Comparative study of different argumentation graphs and UIs could be pretty useful.

Three types of agent: Monitor, Editor, Generator

        
Monitor: monitors the stream, but doesn't alter it
Editor: edits the incoming communication stream
Request: modifies requests

        
Rather like Greasemonkey?

Usability testing at an early stage can mute creative ideas.

CHI pushes for any design to be validated with real users.

CHI is dominated by quantitive usability evaluations (70\%).

Rigorous science would include replication - which never happens in CHI.
